In this paper, we present an application of global sensitivity analysis that is based on quantifies of model output. Specifically, we apply quantile-base sensitivity measures to structural econometric models to identify which parameters contribute most to prediction uncertainty. We employ the Monte Carlo simulation and Double Loop Reordering approach to simulate the quantity of interest.  We analyze the quantities of interest in a Discrete Choice Dynamic Programming model and compare it to traditional local sensitivity analysis approaches. The results show that the conventional practice of using point estimates to predict counterfactuals can be very misleading, whereas the proposed method is limited to computational burdens.
